    "I'm a driven, quick learning, junior software engineer currently working with React, Typescript, and Javascript as a front end developer. My diverse background across a wide range of problem solving situations and long history working with computers allows me to approach issues in an effective and practical manner.",
    "Over the years I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, from personal and hobby pieces to enterprise level software. I've learned a lot along the way about what it takes to build successful software, and I'm always eager to keep learning and growing.",
    "When I'm not coding, you can usually find me tinkering with intergrated tech (think Raspberry Pi, Arduinos, etc) or working on personal projects. I'm a big believer in the power of side projects to help you stay curious, constantly learning, and engaged with the world of technology.",
    "In my free time I enjoy painting miniatures, spending time with family and friends, and seeking out more weird niche prog bands. I'm always up for trying new restaurants or checking out a new museum exhibit.",
    "I'm excited to share some of my work with you through this portfolio. I hope you find it interesting; if you have any questions or just want to talk shop, please feel free to drop me a line!",
    "Cheers!",
